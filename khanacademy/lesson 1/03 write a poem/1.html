        <h3> Lyrics </h3>
        <p> It's been 24 hours <br>
            I'm getting impatient <br>
            I'm sorry you're scared <br>
            The feeling is shared <br>
            I'm sorry, I'm dangerous <br>
            You say we should talk, it's falling apart <br>
            I hate when you say this <br>
            I feel like a child <br>
            I know it's denial <br>
            I'm going through phases <br>
        </p>

        <p> Feel like I'm going insane, I'm going through phases <br>
            Pharmacy's rotting my brain, I'm going through phases <br>
            Heaven is calling my name, I'm going through phases <br>
            Oh, oh, yeah <br>
            I'm going through phases <br>
            I'm going through phases <br>
            I'm going through phases <br>
            I'm going through phases <br>
        </p>

        <p> Uh-uh <br>
            Swim in the dark <br>
            The water is changing <br>
            Floating away, the fear in my brain <br>
            The feeling is fading <br>
            You say it's not me <br>
            I hate when you say this <br>
            I'm falling apart <br>
            I'm starting to scar <br>
            I'm going through phases, yeah <br>
        </p>

        <p> What's the point of love if it's not real? <br>
            Hanging onto me and in your feels <br>
            I can't even tell if it's the same to me <br>
            I'm falling apart, I know it's denial <br>
            I'm going through phases <br>
        </p>

        <p> Feel like I'm going insane, I'm going through phases <br>
            Pharmacy's rotting my brain, I'm going through phases <br>
            Heaven is calling my name, I'm going through phases <br>
            I'm going through phases <br>
            I'm going through phases <br>
            I'm going through phases <br>
            I'm going through phases <br>
        </p>

        <p> Phases <br>
            Phases <br>
            Phases <br>
            Phases <br>
            Phases <br>
            Phases <br>
            I'm going through phases <br>
            I'm going through phases <br>
        </p>
