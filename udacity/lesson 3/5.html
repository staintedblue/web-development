        <h2 class ="book-title"> Robinson Crusoe </h2>
        <p class ="book-summary"> Thought to have been inspired by the true-life experiences of a marooned sailor, 
            Robinson Crusoe tells the story of the sole survivor of a shipwreck, stranded on a Caribbean island,
            who prevails against all odds, enduring almost three decades of solitude while mastering both himself and his strange new world. </p>
        <h2 class = "book-title"> Hatchet </h2>
        <p class = "book-summary"> Thirteen-year-old Brian Robeson is on his way to visit his father when the single-engine plane in which he is flying crashes. 
            Suddenly, Brian finds himself alone in the Canadian wilderness with nothing but a tattered Windbreaker and the hatchet his mother gave him as a present — 
            and the dreadful secret that has been tearing him apart since his parent's divorce.
            But now Brian has no time for anger, self pity, or despair — it will take all his know-how and determination,
            and more courage than he knew he possessed, to survive. </p>
