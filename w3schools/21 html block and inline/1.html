<!-- 
Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.

The two most common display values are block and inline.

Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

The <p> element is a block-level element.

The <div> element is a block-level element. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
    
        <p style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</p>
        <div style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</div>
    
        <p>The P and the DIV elements are both block elements, and they will always start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>
